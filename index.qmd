## Introduction

In contradiction to its name, survival analysis is not just about looking at a subject/entity and how long it will survive, given a defined event. Rather, it's a statistical method that determines the time that elapses to reach a certain event or the time between two events (Clark, Bradburn, Love & Altman, 2003). While it’s most frequently used in the medical field, other uses might include manufacturing, where the ‘event’ may be defined as machine failure or in education, where the event may be defined as dropping out of a certain major or field of study. In this overview analysis, two frequently used methods of survival analysis are presented using the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) data. In addition, an overview of cardiovascular disease and its relevance and impetus in the creation of the JHS is outlined.
